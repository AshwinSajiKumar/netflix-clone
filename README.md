# Netflix-clone
This is a Netflix clone project built using React and the TMDB API to fetch details of popular movies. The application provides a home page with a banner displaying the image of different popular movies. Each time the page is refreshed, a new movie banner will be shown. The home page also contains multiple rows with posters of movies in various categories. Clicking on a movie poster will display a video related to that movie or TV show if available. Please note that some shows might not have any videos as the TMDB API might not have posted them.

Features

Multiple Rows: The home page contains multiple rows with posters of movies in various categories.

Video Playback: Clicking on a movie poster will display a video related to that movie or TV show if available.
